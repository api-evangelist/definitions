  name: Application programming interface for measuring devices
  summary: ""
  abstract: An application programming interface (API) that provides a common interface
    between an application program and plural different types of color measuring devices
    each having at least one color measuring sensor. The API includes plural functions
    for operating any of the plural different types of color measuring devices. In
    order to complete an operation performed by at least one of the plural functions,
    the function that performs the operation must be called a number of times which
    is different for at least two different types of color measuring devices. For
    a particular color measuring device, the API provides the application program
    with flow control data of the number of times that the function must be called.
    This flow control data preferably can be provided by the function, in the form
    of a call-again value or as a numerical value, or by a separate function in the
    API such as a get-device-capabilities function. In some embodiments of the invention,
    a combination of these methods of providing the flow control data is utilized.
    Preferred functions for operating any of the plural different types of color measuring
    devices include a calibrate-position function, a calibrate-sensor function, a
    move-to-patch function, and a make-measurement function.

  name: Collection makefile generator
  summary: ""
  abstract: Collection makefile generators generate comprehensive makefiles for processing
    collections of computer files. In operation, the present collection makefile generator
    dynamically discovers collection content files, classifies them according to content
    type and required processing actions, and then generates a makefile for performing
    those actions. Importantly, all build order dependencies are properly maintained
    among multiple collection products and among individual collection content files.
    Automated collection makefile generators drastically improve the productivity
    of human workers by effectively reducing makefile creation and maintenance costs
    to zero. Collection makefile generators thus enable humans to easily generate
    complex makefiles in an automated, scalable way that was not previously possible.

  name: Circuit for generating a centered reference voltage for a 1T/1C ferroelectric
    memory
  summary: ""
  abstract: A ferroelectric reference circuit generates a reference voltage proportional
    to (P+U)/2 and is automatically centered between the bit line voltages corresponding
    to the P term and the U term across wide temperature and voltage ranges. To avoid
    fatiguing the reference ferroelectric capacitors generating (P+U)/2, the reference
    voltage is refreshed once every millisecond. To eliminate the variation of the
    reference voltage due to the leakage in the ferroelectric capacitors during this
    period of time, the reference voltage generated from the reference ferroelectric
    capacitors is digitized when it is refreshed. The digital value is fixed and converted
    to an analog value which is then fed into sense amplifiers for resolving the data
    states. The reference voltage is automatically at the center of the switching
    (P) and non-switching (U) signals and therefore the signal margin is maximized.

  name: Rolling cache configuration for a data replication system
  summary: ""
  abstract: Performing data management operations on replicated data in a computer
    network. Log entries are generated for data management operations of an application
    executing on a source system. Consistency point entries are used to indicate a
    time of a known good, or recoverable, state of the application. A destination
    system is configured to process a copy of the log and consistency point entries
    to replicate data in a replication volume, the replicated data being a copy of
    the application data on the source system. When the replicated data represents
    a known good state of the application, as determined by the consistency point
    entries, the destination system(s) may perform a storage operation (e.g., snapshot,
    backup) to copy the replicated data and to logically associate the copied data
    with a time information (e.g., time stamp) indicative of the source system time
    when the application was in the known good state.

  name: System and method for replicating offline scheduling transactions from a client

  summary: ""
  abstract: A facility for replicating offline scheduling transactions directed to
    a server is provided. The facility is implemented as a client-side application
    that integrates with and utilizes components of a store-and-forward application,
    which is operable to execute on a client to guarantee that transactions submitted
    on the client are replicated and carried out on a service hosted on a remote server
    even in light of intermittent connectivity between the client, the server, and
    networks. Records describing transactions intended remote service are written
    to an outbox of the store-and-forward application on the client. When online,
    the store-and-forward application first invokes the facility, which processes
    the items in the outbox by iteratively retrieving the items from the outbox and,
    for each item, determining whether the item is a transaction intended for the
    scheduling application. If the item is intended for the scheduling application,
    the facility sends the item to the scheduling application. Otherwise, if the item
    is not intended for the scheduling application, the facility returns the item
    to the outbox for processing by other components of the store-and-forward application.

  name: Apparatus and method for instant messaging collaboration
  summary: ""
  abstract: An apparatus and method for instant message transmission includes a message
    center coupled to one or more servers and to an event engine by a network. An
    instant message is transmitted to the message center by the event engine over
    the network. An algorithm determines the optimum path for the transmission of
    the instant message. Users may share identical data via instant messaging, and
    may make changes to the data as it is streamed in real-time to designated users
    over the network. It is emphasized that this abstract is provided to comply with
    the rules requiring an abstract that will allow a searcher or other reader to
    quickly ascertain the subject matter of the technical disclosure. It is submitted

  name: User-space probe based debugging
  summary: ""
  abstract: Methods and systems for user-space probe debugging are described. In one
    embodiment, a computing system receives a request from a user interface to debug
    a target application. In response to the request, the computing system runs the
    target application in a debug mode with an attached debugger. The debugger and
    the target application appear as a single application in a user-space of the computing
    system. The debugger has access to application memory of the target application.
    The computing system receives a command to perform a debug operation on the target
    application, such as setting a breakpoint, reading the application memory, or
    the like. The debugger performs the debug operation on the target application
    without communicating with a kernel of the computing system, and outputs debug
    information after performing the debug operation.

    are generated for each class variable. Additionally, a serialization method and
    a constructor method are generated for each class. These classes and methods are
