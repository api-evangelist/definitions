  name: Instruction execution control device and instruction execution control method
  summary: ""
  abstract: An instruction execution control device operates a plurality of threads
    in a simultaneous multi-thread system. The device has architecture registers (--)
    for each thread, and a selection circuit () which, when an operand data required
    for executing a function is read from a register file (), selects in advance a
    thread to be read from the register file (). This makes it possible to select
    an architecture register at an early stage, and although the number of circuits
    in a portion for selecting the architecture registers increases, the wiring amount
    of the circuits can be decreased, because the architecture register of the thread
    to be read is selected in advance.

  name: System and method for replicating offline scheduling transactions from a client
    to a server
  summary: ""
  abstract: A facility for replicating offline scheduling transactions directed to
    a server is provided. The facility is implemented as a client-side application
    that integrates with and utilizes components of a store-and-forward application,
    which is operable to execute on a client to guarantee that transactions submitted
    on the client are replicated and carried out on a service hosted on a remote server
    even in light of intermittent connectivity between the client, the server, and
    networks. Records describing transactions intended remote service are written
    to an outbox of the store-and-forward application on the client. When online,
    the store-and-forward application first invokes the facility, which processes
    the items in the outbox by iteratively retrieving the items from the outbox and,
    for each item, determining whether the item is a transaction intended for the
    scheduling application. If the item is intended for the scheduling application,
    the facility sends the item to the scheduling application. Otherwise, if the item
    is not intended for the scheduling application, the facility returns the item
    to the outbox for processing by other components of the store-and-forward application.

  name: Seal assembly with anti-rotation pin for high pressure supercritical fluids
  summary: ""
  abstract: A seal assembly for sealing a machine with a first chamber and a second
    chamber is provided. A rotating shaft extends through the first and second chambers,
    and rotates therein. The seal assembly has a seal housing, a seal ring and a seal
    pin. The seal housing is positionable in the machine housing. The seal housing
    has a seal pocket extending into a fluid side thereof, and a housing receptacle
    extending into an inner diameter thereof at the seal pocket. The seal ring is
    positionable in the seal pocket of the seal housing for forming a seal therewith.
    The seal ring has a ring receptacle extending into an outer diameter thereof.
    The ring receptacle is positionable adjacent to the housing receptacle for defining
    a pin hole therebetween. The seal pin is loosely positionable in the pin hole
    whereby movement about the seal ring is accommodated while preventing rotation
    thereof.

  name: Secure communication of distributed ruby requests
  summary: ""
  abstract: Various embodiments of systems and methods for providing a secure communication
    are described herein. A client application generates a Distributed Ruby (DRb)
    request based on a request received from a user. The obtained DRb request is wrapped
    to obtain an HTTPS request, which includes the DRb request and one or more authentication
    information. The generated HTTPS request is forwarded to an HTTPS server, which
    verifies the HTTPS request based on the authentication information. The HTTPS
    request is then unwrapped to obtain the DRb request, which is executed by a DRb
    server to obtain a result of execution of the DRb request.

    a logical object in order to minimize a representational gap between the client

  name: Process for serializing and deserializing data described by a schema
  summary: ""
  abstract: A process for serializing and deserializing instance data from a schema
    is disclosed. A schema can be used to automatically and dynamically generate classes
    and methods. First, the raw schema may be parsed into an intermediate data structure
    consisting of <key,value> pairs representing object properties and attributes
    of the properties. Then, an exemplary process generates new parser classes and
    methods by iterating over the intermediate data structure's keys and generating
    classes or class variables based on the property type. Accessors and mutators
    are generated for each class variable. Additionally, a serialization method and
    a constructor method are generated for each class. These classes and methods are
    stored in memory and can be used by a host programming language to transmit, receive,
    and manipulate data to or from an API.

  summary: ""
  abstract: Schema information is provided with transmission of a data object. When
    a data object is converted to a transmission format, schema information for the

    The schema registry may then be used as a tool for converting the transmission
    format element back to the data element. The next time an object of that object
    type is sent to the recipient, the schema information is not added to the transmission
    format element.
