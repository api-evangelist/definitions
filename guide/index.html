<h2>My Industry Guide To API Definitions</h2>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/jxcvi8wng2"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/whitepapers/design/api-evangelist-api-design-guide-may-2016-cover.png" align="right" width="25%" /></a></p>
<p>I research many aspects of the API space, and I've carved off a specific area to keep track of what is happening with API specifications, definitions, schema, and scopes. I publish all of this research regularly to a Github repository, within the API Evangelist organization.</p>
<p>When possible, I take each of my top reserch areas, and distill them down into a single industry guide, providing a snapshot of the world of API definitions. I'm looking to create a single digest of everything I'm seeing happening across the sector.</p>
<p>I am currently evolving the layout and process for my API industry guides. I have a draft copy of my API definition industry guide available in the Github repository for this area of my research. You can still get a copy of the previous API definition guide, but you can also get at the draft of the next version as well.</p>
