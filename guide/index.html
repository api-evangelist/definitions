<h2>My Industry Guide To API Definitions</h2>
<p><a href="http://apis.how/jxcvi8wng2"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://definitions.apievangelist.com/guide/api-evangelist-api-definitions-guide-may-2016-cover.png" align="right" width="25%" /></a></p>
<p>I research many areas of the API space, and I've carved off a specific project to keep track of what is happening with API specifications, definitions, schema, and scopes. I publish all of this research regularly to <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions">a Github repository</a>, within the <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist">API Evangelist organization</a>.</p>
<p>When I can, I take each of my top reserch areas and distill them down into a single industry guide, providing a single portable snapshot of the world of API definitions--one that is updated regularly, keeping pace with what is going on.</p>
<p>I am currently evolving the layout and process for my API industry guides. <a href="http://definitioins.apievangelist.com/guide/2017-03/">I have a draft copy of my API definition industry guide available in the Github repository</a> for this area of my research. You can still get a copy of the previous API definition guide, but you can also get at the draft of the next version as well.</p>
<p>Each of my API industry guides include opportunities for sponsored content, as well as possessing extra sponsorship slots for my partners, and folks who help me edit each guide--if you'd like to get involved you can email <a href="mailto: info@apievangelist.com">info@apievangelist.com</a>.</p>
