<p>As I do my regular monitoring of the API space, these are the common " . $tag . " tools that I have identified so far. If there are tools or other resources that you think should be listed, let me know.

<a href="https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint/" id="home-name-link-727" style="color: #000;"><strong>API Blueprint</strong></a><p>API Blueprint is a documentation-oriented API description language. A couple of semantic assumptions over the plain Markdown. API Blueprint is perfect for designing your Web API and its comprehensive documentation but also for quick prototyping and collaboration. It is easy to learn and even easier to read &ndash; after all it is just a form of plain text. API Blueprint, its parser, and most of its tools are completely open sourced so you don't have to worry about vendor lock-in. This also means you can freely integrate API Blueprint into any type of product, commercial or not.</p>

<a href="http://raml.org" id="home-name-link-810" style="color: #000;"><strong>RAML Specification</strong></a><p>RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices. The goal is to help our current API ecosystem by solving immediate problems and then encourage ever-better API patterns. RAML is built on broadly-used standards such as YAML and JSON and is a non-proprietary, vendor-neutral open spec.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/" id="home-name-link-178" style="color: #000;"><strong>Swagger Specification</strong></a><p>Swagger is a simple yet robust representation of a RESTful API, with a large ecosystem of API tooling that includes code generation, interactive documentation, and much more. Currently &nbsp;there are housands of developers supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment, using the&nbsp;100% open source software and specification.</p>
